# Twitter API & Caching

This program query the hashtag “#2020election” using Twitter Standard Search API, retrieve 100 tweets relevant to this query, and find the hashtag that most commonly co-occurs with “#2020election”. I review using OAuth to access and retrieve data from Web APIs, caching the data that is returned, and conducting some basic data processing and analysis.
